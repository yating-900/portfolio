          <div class="text-block-11">The covid-19 pandemic makes <span class="text-span-6">remote work become a trend</span>. Governments and companies offer policies and infrastructure to support working remotely.  As the graphs below indicate, over half of the participants stated that they were totally working remotely. They also stated that the main struggles with working remotely include hard to unplug and distractions at home.<br><br>Resulting from the pandemic, both of me and a friend of mine started to remote work since early 2020. Similar to many of the others, we found it hard to stay concentrated at home. Moreover we had some neck and back pain lacking of exercise. We talked about these problems, and thought maybe we could create an App that helps people to become more productive an healthy when working remotely. <br><br></div>

Then to build the MVP and release the initial version. Afterwards, we would collect the feedback and iterate on the products. As the product becomes better and better, it will have an organic growth of users. Later on we can monetize from either Freemium or ads.<br><br>I take the main responsibility for the product design and management, while my friend in charge of App development. Actually none of us had experience of independent App development before. So we spent one month to learn Flutter, which is a cross-platform language to build native Apps on Android and iOS from a single Codebase. We designed and developed the App within three months and had the initial release to Google Play in July 2020.<br></div><img src="../images/Roadmap.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" srcset="../images/Roadmap-p-500.png 500w, ../images/Roadmap-p-800.png 800w, ../images/Roadmap-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/Roadmap-p-1600.png 1600w, ../images/Roadmap.png 1886w" alt="" class="image-67">

              <p>Fiona is a biology Phd worker in Switzerland. Currently she works on her research paper. She spent 70% of her work time at home and 30% in the lab. <br>‍<br>&quot;I have lots of time to work on my research paper. To have a better use of the time, I have tried some time management tools. For instance, I have tried an App named &#x27;Forest&#x27; to help me stay focused using a Timer. It was interesting at the beginning, but I deleted the App after a while since the App gives me a feeling like a control freak.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I have some neck and shoulder problems for a long time...

              <div class="text-block-2">I looked up online to find time management methods. One of the most popular ones is the <span class="yellow-bg">Pomodoro technique.</span> It breaks down a long work time into smaller chunks. Basically you set the timer for 25 minutes and stay focused during the time. After the focus session, you can take a rest as a small reward. Then you continue the next iteration. I tried it myself and found it improved my productivity when working at home.<strong></strong><br></div>

Also the statistic reports can motivate users and help habit forming.<br></div>

          <div class="text-block-2">1.

          <div class="text-block-2">2. Focus experience customization: users can adjust the time duration based on their preferences. They can also select an ambient sound which helps them to focus.

          <div class="text-block-2">3.

          <div class="text-block-2">The first major setback we encountered was the launch of the Apple market. At the beginning, we chose to use Flutter to develop, mainly because it is compatible with Android and Apple. We only need one set of code to be able to put on the two mainstream markets at the same time. In the early days, we mainly used Android for testing. Soon after we started to use Apple for testing, we realized the background running problem which there was no quick solution. That&#x27;s why we only launched it in Google Play so far.<br><br></div>

            <div class="column-22 w-col w-col-6">
              <div class="text-block-2">The second difficulty is to solve the problem of low application stability. It is often killed when running in the background. If the phone is old and has low memory, it is easier for the system to stop Foca. Our app has been rated very well in the early stage of its launch, and it was once maintained at around 4.8. However, due to stability reasons, we were given two negative reviews. In the feedback, users complained that it suddenly stopped when it was running halfway through, and the experience was very bad. So our rating dropped to 4.4 all at once... I quickly responded to the problem, and listed the solutions we had:<br>‍<br><strong>Short-term solution</strong><br>Provide instructions to setup, in order to improve stability, as the design shows besides.<br>‍<br><strong>Long-term solution</strong><br>Improve back-end coding. It might take some time for the developer Raphael to debug and improve coding stability.<br></div>

          <div class="text-block-2">Even in a small team of two people, communication is still very important. In many cases, opinions are not unified, and the information received is not equal. Because I have done a lot of user interviews, and I pay a lot of attention to comments and feedback. But this part of the information program partners may not know. This leads to our frequent disagreements. It is easy to substitute your own subjective feelings. So later on I shared the collected user research information with my peers in time. Both positive and negative will be shared. Positive feedback is a great affirmation for us and a motivation to continue to sit down. Negative feedback allows us to discover the problem and the direction for improvement.<br><br>In this project, I have taken multiple responsibilities beyond just being a designer. I feel it&#x27;s more suitable to call myself as a product creator in this case. I believe in the value of the product and always feel motivated to make it better. This makes me think about my career choice in the future. When I have to make career decisions, I should ask myself:  do you really love the product you are going to design and agree with the values behind it? If not then there should be a second thought. If the answer is yes, then definitely go for it!<br></div>
